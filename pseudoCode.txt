#include msp430, maze header, ir header
	this will also require an implementation file

void main(){
	initialize motor pins and LEDs, calibrate clock, ect.
	
	_delay_cycles() so the user can move
	
	calibrating the sensors would be nice?
	
	while(1){	//infinite loop
		while (the front sensor is less than threshold0{
			//go straight
			get the left/ right difference
				this will be done my subtracting getRight() from getLeft()
				also may need to be normailzed with reference to the characterization
					from A funct, lab07
				
			
			if (left < right) {
				increase left, decrease right
			}
			else if (left > right) {
				decrea right, increase left
			}
			
			delay, so not jerky?
			
		}//there is a wall
		
		stop the robot
		wait
		compare sensors
		if (left < right) {
			turn right
		}
		else {
			turn left
		}
		stop, delay - will loop and go forward again
	}//end infinite while
}//end main

put the Timer A interrupts here
	i already have these coded from Lab6!
